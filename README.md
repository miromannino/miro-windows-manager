# Miro Windows Manager

With this script you will be able to move windows around your screen by using your keyboard!

Windows can be resized to full-screen, resized in halves or in corners or moved to other screens in case of multiple monitors using your keyboard. 

This can all be done by using a special (i.e. hyper) key in your keyboard and arrows. Other projects instead move windows in halves using arrows, and in corners using other counterintuitive shortcuts, like letters, which makes things confusing.

This script needs Hammerspoon in order to work.

## How to install

 - Extract the zip file, containing `MiroWindowsManager.spoon` in `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons`
 - Now you need to configure Hammerspoon in order to load this spoon in `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons/MiroWindowsManager.spoon` adding the following snippet of code in your `init.lua` file:
```
local hyper = {"ctrl", "alt", "cmd"}

hs.loadSpoon("MiroWindowsManager")

hs.window.animationDuration = 0.3
spoon.MiroWindowsManager:bindHotkeys({
  up = {hyper, "up"},
  right = {hyper, "right"},
  down = {hyper, "down"},
  left = {hyper, "left"},
  fullscreen = {hyper, "f"},
  nextscreen = {hyper, "n"},
  previousscreen = {hyper, "p"}
})
```

## Shortcuts

In the snippet above configure Miro's Windows Manager in the following way:

### Hyper key

 The hyper key is defined as `ctrl` + `alt` + `cmd`. This means that each shortcut will start by pressing these three keys. If you consider this too verbose for your personal keyboard interactions, you can also change it, for example replacing it with an unused key (e.g. caps lock key) with [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) and [Seil](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/seil.html.en) to act as hyper key.

### Move in halves

 - `hyper` + `up`: move to the top half of the screen
 - `hyper` + `right`: move to the right half of the screen
 - `hyper` + `down`: move to the bottom half of the screen
 - `hyper` + `left`: move to the left half of the screen

By repeating these shortcuts the window is resized to be one third or two thirds and again in one half. 

### Move to corners

 - `hyper` + `up` + `right`: move the window to the top-right corner
 - `hyper` + `down` + `right`: move the window to the bottom-right corner
 - `hyper` + `up` + `left`: move the window to the top-left corner
 - `hyper` + `down` + `left`: move the window to the bottom-left corner

 When the window is in the corner, it will have one half of screen height and one half of screen width. 
 The arrows can be used to expand the height/width to be one third, two thirds or again one half. 
 For example if the window is in the top-right corner, pressing `hyper` + `up` the window height will be resized to be one third, while pressing `hyper` + `right` the window width will be resized to be one third; in this case `hyper` + `left` and `hyper` + `down` will move the window to the top-left and bottom-right corners, respectively.

### Expand to fit the entire height or width

These are useful in case the window is in one of the corners.

 - `hyper` + `up` + `down`: expand the height to fit the entire screen height
 - `hyper` + `right` + `left`: expand the width to fit the entire screen width

### Expand to fullscreen

 - `hyper` + `f`: expand to be full screen

Note that in case the window is resized to be a half of the screen, you can also use `hyper` + `up` + `down` (or `hyper` + `right` + `left`) to resize the window full screen.

As the other shortcuts, `hyper` + `f` can be pressed multiple times to obtain a centered window of three fourth and one half of height and width. This behaviour can be customized.

### Move to other display

 - `hyper` + `n`: move to next monitor.
 - `hyper` + `p`: move to previous monitor.

 Hitting the shortcuts multiple times will rotate between the number of monitors

## Animations

The snippet above configures the animation to last `0.3s` with `hs.window.animationDuration = 0.3`. To remove the animations completely change this value to `0`.

> Really loving the arrow based positioning, thanks for making this ! I can now uninstall “spectacle” which I was using for the same purpose but the key bindings were unintuitive.

> the only issue I have with miro-windows-manager is the fact that I didn't discover it sooner. just getting into HammerSpoon and love this 🥄 ... so handy, nice work @miromannino !

> I've been using Hammerspoon for years with my own simple window management bindings. For most of that time I've been meaning to spend the effort to improve them to enable e.g. cycling through sizes and easier corner management. In a fit of procrastination I decided that today's the day to build that setup. But after a quick search and finding this package, it took me all of 5 minutes to rip out my config and replace it with this, and procrastination avoided!
>Well done, very much appreciated!
